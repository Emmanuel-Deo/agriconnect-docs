Lesson learned- elements of Success
----


A. National Nutrition Campaign:
--------------------------------
The National Nutrition Campaign succeeded by strategically using the use of popular social media platforms like 
Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and Twitter proved instrumental in maximizing the campaign's reach. A major factor 
in its success was recognizing that social media influencers had a greater impact than institutional websites in reaching 
a broad and varied audience. 

By tapping into influencers who had already earned the trust of their communities, the 
campaign was able to quickly and efficiently spread its nutrition message. The project noticed that influencer platforms 
(MCL X_Space & influencer (Peter Msechu) social media posting) were relatable and credible, helping spread the 
message in a way that traditional media outlets could not. For example, the designed nine (9) topics to 
comprehensively address critical aspects of nutrition and health through X Space taking place every Monday from 
July 4, 2024, to August 26, 2024, managed to reach 39,473 participants. On TV Educational Cooking programme the 
social account was reached by 85,981 and viewer of advert L- Shaped in MCL was 4,038,534. 

These platforms have massive user bases, especially among younger and more digitally connected audiences. Influencers on these 
platforms can quickly engage with their followers, ensuring that the campaign’s message reaches individuals who 
might not typically access traditional nutrition information through newspapers or television or institution websites. 
This approach helped create an inclusive, widespread reach for the message. While using social media influencers can 
be a powerful strategy for public campaigns, it is essential to approach it with careful consideration of the right 
influencers, clear communication, and an understanding of the potential risks involved.


Furthermore, the campaign also benefited from its strategic placement in newspapers, along with its availability on 
various platforms, such as the print edition, e-gazette, nation e-paper, and M-paper. This multi-platform distribution 
allowed the campaign to reach both traditional and digital audiences, thus expanding its visibility. Publishing in both 
Kiswahili and English further enhanced the accessibility of the message, catering to a broad demographic and ensuring 
that the content was understood across different language communities.


The campaign also featured creative elements, including cartoons. The episodes emphasized the importance of 
nutrition-sensitive farming and healthy diets. These cartoons provided an engaging way for children to learn about 
nutrition and beneficial agricultural practices. By introducing these concepts through relatable, entertaining content, 
the campaign effectively increased knowledge among young audiences, helping them understand both healthy diets 
and the importance of sustainable farming practices from an early age. 


The project also reinforced the key message of healthy diets and sustainable agricultural practices as essential to 
building healthy communities on popular social media platforms like Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and X-Space 
through paid advertisements. These platforms not only reach a vast audience but also encourage community 
engagement through interactive content, such as challenges and live discussions. By leveraging influencers and 
relatable narratives, the project aims to inspire positive lifestyle changes and promote awareness of nutritional choices.


The campaign also featured creative elements, including TV Educational Cooking Programme on healthy diets. The 
use of TV as a dissemination platform for FBDGs was particularly effective, reaching diverse audiences, including 
rural populations with limited access to other educational content. One of the key lessons learned was the importance 
of involving influential public figures and local leaders to enhance outreach and legitimacy. High-profile personalities, 
such as the First Lady of Zanzibar (10,42717 people were reached by her episode), politicians, and entertainers 
significantly boosted the visibility and acceptance of the project. This demonstrated that the strategic involvement of 
respected figures can inspire trust and motivate communities to adopt health and education messages. Similarly, 
engaging local leaders fostered trust and participation at the grassroots level, proving that community-driven 
approaches are essential for sustainability.


This highlighted the power of culturally relevant mass media in public health education, where engaging and practical 
content bridges gaps in nutrition education. Future programs can scale this approach to maximize impact. Another 
critical success factor was designing culturally relevant recipes that aligned with local dietary habits. By using locally 
available ingredients and familiar cooking methods, the project ensured the guidelines were practical and relatable. 
This reinforced the importance of cultural sensitivity when promoting behavioral change.


The establishment of community kitchens with trained Community Health Workers (CHWs) was a sustainable 
intervention. These kitchens serve as knowledge hubs, enabling continued cooking demonstrations and dietary 
education even after project completion. The provision of supporting facilities and tools, along with active supervision 
by local authorities, ensured ownership and sustainability. This approach demonstrated that participatory models foster 
acceptance and long-term success, making it easily adaptable in other contexts

B. Daladala Nutrition Education Tour
-----------------------------------

FAO introduced an innovative "Daladala Nutrition Education Tour," (the mobile classroom) promoting healthy dietary 
practices in three cities: Dar es Salaam, Zanzibar, and Mbeya. The initiative featured organized trips for adults and 
students, focusing on the National Food-Based Dietary Guidelines (FBDGs). Nutritionists (20) and teachers facilitated 
the tours, which were designed to engage participants with on-the-go learning and physical materials. The campaign 
conducted 14 routes (Dar es salaam (4) Zanzibar (6) and Mbeya (4) with 339 trips (four daily trips per day), reaching 
8,628 passengers, including 3,498 men, 5,130 women, and 598 students in three cities. 
The Daladala Nutrition Education Tour successfully demonstrated that mobile learning can be an effective tool for 
community-based nutrition education. By utilizing daladala minibuses as mobile classrooms, the campaign reached 
people in their daily routines, increasing accessibility and engagement. The collaboration with key stakeholders, 
including FAO, the Ministry of Agriculture, TFNC, and local authorities, strengthened the campaign’s credibility and 
expanded its reach. Diverse outreach strategies, such as nutrition-themed tickets, food vouchers, and social media 
campaigns, enhanced message retention, while the involvement of media influencers and musicians helped extend 
awareness beyond direct participants. 

Furthermore, structured routes, practical incentives, and engagement with youth 
through school participation contributed to the overall success and scalability of the initiative.
Despite these achievements, the campaign faced several challenges that impacted its effectiveness. Logistical issues, 
such as student holidays in Dar es Salaam and LATRA travel restrictions in Mbeya, led to scheduling delays. Health 
concerns, including a potential cholera outbreak in Mbeya, limited some planned activities. Additionally, the transient 
nature of routes meant that some passengers could not complete full learning sessions, leading to varied engagement 
levels. Challenges in the absence of a structured post-campaign follow-up further highlighted areas for improvement 
in future initiatives.


C. The Implementation of the Solidarity...
---------------------------------------

The Solidarity Chain PMU (Poultry Mother) project at Masaulwa and Mahenje schools offers a successful model for 
integrating agricultural education with community development. It demonstrates how effective community 
engagement, practical learning, and self-sustaining financial models can benefit students and the broader community. 
By involving local communities in planning and execution, the project ensures sustainability and strengthens 
commitment to its success. The project teaches students practical skills in animal husbandry, nutrition, and financial 
management, which they can share with their families.
A key success of the project is its self-sustaining financial model. The school generates income from selling eggs and 
chickens, which is reinvested to sustain the project. Efficient resource management, such as balancing the poultry 
stock, and targeted resource distribution, like prioritizing egg allocation to younger students, also contribute to the 
project's sustainability. This model has the potential to be replicated in other schools and communities, as it showcases 
how educational and economic growth can go hand in hand. The positive outcomes at these two schools encourage 
other institutions to adopt similar initiatives, creating broader impact.

D. The National-Base Zoom Cloud Workshop
---------------------------------------

The 10 workshops on online health and nutrition education were successful in using technology to engage a broad 
audience (50,548) with practical, locally relevant content on the concept of FBDGs. The participant-centered approach 
made the sessions interactive, allowing participants to share experiences. Expert-led discussions and community 
involvement as part of the initiative made educational content more relevant and increased the use of social media and 
online platforms to reach more people and keep them involved. Open dialogue, social media engagement, and 
feedback for continuous improvement drove the initiative's success. They challenged existing beliefs and sparked new 
ideas, reaching a wide group through social media and word of mouth. The 2-hour format was concise and engaging, 
promoting effective learning. To scale this initiative, continued virtual workshops and community-based activities are 
essential. Additionally, a strategy for ongoing education, such as quarterly
