Lessons Learned - Impediments/Constraints
==========================================

• While the Solidarity Chain PMU (Poultry Mother) project has been successful, several constraints have highlighted areas for improvement. Initially, the schools lacked proper infrastructure for housing the chickens.  Early construction of appropriate facilities, with community involvement, proved essential for animal welfare  and project ownership. Coordination challenges, especially during weekends and holidays, required effective  scheduling and clear responsibilities. To maintain consistency, a sustainable volunteer system and parental  involvement were necessary.

• A study to assess the risk of AR and AMR in complementary foods from selected AGRICONNECT markets was conducted. Based on evidence, children under five bear 40% of the burden of foodborne infections,  with 150,000 deaths annually. High levels of antimicrobial residues in nutritious foods have been observed,  indicate Milk from dairy cattle in Tanzania is the most risk complementary food commodity due to  antimicrobials. Oxytetracycline, Amoxicillin and Trimethoprim are the most common antibiotics that make milk  unsafe. Withdrawal period after treatment of animals is not observed thus serving as critical pathway of exposure.  Estimates for amount of milk and eggs recommend for daily consumption in children in view of prevailing  quality in Tanzania are lacking. Lessons Learned; The One Health Approach successfully identified and assessed antimicrobial hazards for children under five years old, but the lack of reliable data on these hazards in animals, food, and the environment makes it challenging to fully understand the risks. Coordination between various sectors, such as public health, agriculture, and environmental protection, can lead to policy implementation and strategy integration. Financial and infrastructural constraints can hinder the implementation of effective antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance and mitigation strategies. The National Action Plan for AMR (2023-2028) provided a strategic framework for addressing AMR. Stakeholders must raise awareness of risk associations (AR and AMR) throughout the value chain for complementary food, minimize the occurrence of infected animals through efficient prevention strategies and on-farm biosecurity protocols, and enhance the application of antimicrobial agents in animal health while adhering to the withdrawal period.

• Declining Print Circulation Vs Audience Demographics: Print circulation rates have declined, especially among younger and women readers, due to the availability of free online content. Online platforms have  experienced rapid growth in readership due to their convenience and diverse interests. As younger generations shift towards digital media, online news consumption has significantly increased. Print newspapers depend on subscription fees, advertising revenue, and sales to sustain operations. Digital platforms generate revenue through targeted advertising, subscriptions, affiliate links, and sponsored content. As ad-blocking software rises, platforms are experimenting with new business models like paywalls and memberships. Online platforms have become the dominant source of news consumption due to their speed, convenience, and constantly updated content.

• School garden: The issue of unreliable access to water in schools presents a substantial barrier to the sustainability of water-dependent projects, particularly in regions where water scarcity is prevalent. Several schools faced significant challenges, especially during the dry season, when water sources such as wells and rivers became unreliable. For many schools, this unreliable access resulted in increased costs and logistical hurdles. In some cases, schools without direct access to water had to depend on distant sources, like household wells or nearby rivers. The cost of water and the challenge of transporting it to the school often strained resources. Additionally, schools located near rivers faced added risks. Dangerous currents, flooding, and the presence of wildlife such as crocodiles created hazards for both students and the gardens, which were intended to help improve the community's sustainability.Addressing these challenges requires a multifaceted approach, including infrastructure improvements like water harvesting systems, safe and reliable water sources, and effective risk management strategies to mitigate the environmental threats posed by flooding and wildlife. Ensuring reliable access to water is crucial for the long-term success of educational projects that rely on it. The path toward sustainable communities is paved with challenges, particularly when it comes to managing wildlife hazards that threaten both students and gardens. To effectively mitigate these risks, it is essential to invest in infrastructure improvements, implement safe water sources, and develop comprehensive risk management strategies.Logistical Challenges such as long breaks Holidays and school closures, particularly during holidays, disrupted the care and maintenance of the gardens, leading to inconsistent gardening practices and hindered growth. Limited Access to Fertilizer (farmyard manure) in Zanzibar resulted in poor soil fertility, which made it challenging for schools to establish and maintain thriving vegetable gardens. These constraints collectively hindered the success of the project, emphasizing the need for more robust solutions to address water access, financial sustainability, weather unpredictability, and soil fertility in future school garden initiatives
